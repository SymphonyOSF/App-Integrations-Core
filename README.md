# Integrations Core Documentation

This document provides a brief overview of Integration Core components and how to build them from scratch.

# Overview

Integration Core is responsible to managed active integrations and provides key services to allow third party
services the ability to post messages into a configurable set of streams.

The key services provided to the registered integrations are:

* Authentication proxy - each integration should be configured with credentials, but the implementation never needs
to deal with them.  Once bootstrapped, the integration can use integration bridge services as if it's unauthenticated.
The bridge itself proxies those services to the cloud with the proper authentication.
* Send messages to a stream
* Read and write configuration information to the cloud configuration services
* Read user information to the cloud user services
* Health check

# Installation instructions for the Java developer

### What you’ll build
You’ll build a simple java web application that provides the key services described above.

### What you’ll need
* JDK 1.7
* Maven 3.0.5+

### Build with maven
Integration Core is compatible with Apache Maven 3.0.5 or above. If you don’t already have Maven installed you can
follow the instructions at maven.apache.org.

To start from scratch, do the following:

1. Clone the source repository using Git:
   `git clone https://github.com/SymphonyOSF/App-Integrations-Core.git`
2. cd into _App-Integrations-Core_
3. Build using maven:
   `mvn clean install`

Notes: If you have no access to Symphony Artifactory you should build the _App-Integrations-Commons_ previously.
